# Progress

Tracks implementation status per workflow. Update this file as each workflow moves from designed to implemented.

## Open decisions (not yet resolved)

- IaC tool: Terraform vs AWS CDK
- AWS credential setup on this machine for the target account/region
- Whether the demo needs to be always-live or can be brought up on demand (affects whether the DynamoDB-graph swap for Neptune is worth doing up front — see [05](designs/05-observability-cost.md))
- Eval strategy for retrieval quality and answer groundedness

## Suggested build order

1. Ingestion & Refresh Pipeline — nothing else has data to work with until this exists
2. Retrieval Agents & Query Orchestration — the core of the product
3. Inference Serving details (retry/timeout/streaming) — harden alongside #2
4. Image Upload & Multimodal Query
5. Observability & Cost Controls — instrument as each piece above lands, not after the fact
6. Frontend Hosting — last, once there's an API worth putting a UI in front of
